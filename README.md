<p align="center"> A CMS for reading and writing stories in a online magazine format.</p>

This repository powers an online magazine where regular people contribute sincere and honest nonfiction stories. It basically contains a fully-fledged CMS (content-management system) with passwordless authentication. I needed something similar to Wordpress and Ghost, but I wanted more control in the layout and the interface so I decided to write it myself. 

*anonfiction* is written in Go with the [Gin web framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and the CSS framework is in [Tachyon](http://www.tachyons.io). The database uses [BoltDB via @asdine's storm interface](https://github.com/asdine/storm) and my simple [schollz/jsonstore](https://github.com/schollz/jsonstore). All changes to every story are saved via [schollz/versionedtext](github.com/schollz/versionedtext). The built-in editor comes from [basecamp/trix](https://github.com/basecamp/trix).

Please fork this project, steal ideas from it, contribute to it, love it, or hate it.

## Why?

I decided to make an effort to make a place on the Internet that is more positive and reflective. This place would be where you can present your own story, anonymously and sincerely. A place where you don't have to be an MFA to present a good story. I wrote [a blog post with more of my reasoning](https://schollz.github.io/anonfiction).

## Install

First install the dependencies using Go:

```
go get -u -v github.com/schollz/anonfiction
```

Then `cd` into the `$GOPATH` and build:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/schollz/anonfiction
go build
./anonfiction
```

The passwordless login requires an email server in production, but it is disabled by default (so anyone can login to anything). If you'd like to use it, I suggest getting [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/).
